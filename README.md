cd ios
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

##### Preparation:
1. Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) in your system.

2. Clone this repo.

3. Download the prebuilt third party dependencies from this link: https://mega.nz/#!kAsQia7A!6-E0wO2N8BwSGfucwQRQ0mEWU1Yz-s-OjbaG3Vixb0M.

4. Uncompress that file and move the folders `webrtc` , `include` and `lib` into `iMEGA/Vendor/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`.

5. Open `iMEGA.xcworkspace`.

6. Make sure the `MEGA` target is selected.

7. Build and run (âŒ˜R).

8. Enjoy!

If you want to build the third party dependencies by yourself: 
- Open a terminal in the directory `iMEGA/sdk/bindings/ios/3rdparty`. 
- Run sh build-all.sh --enable-chat (Wait until the process ends, it will take some time, ~30 minutes). 

To build all third party dependencies, you need to have installed: `autoconf`, `automake`, `cmake` and `libtool`.
